= Exercises on coroutines and structured concurrency

== Introduction

Set of exercises about coroutines and structured concurrency.

== Exercises

For the execution of the code samples present in this set, ensure the following content is present in the file `src/main/resources/simplelogger.properties`.

.Simple logger configuration
[source, properties]
----
org.slf4j.simpleLogger.showDateTime=true
----

Also, ensure that the following dependencies are included.

.Dependencies
[source, properties]
----
dependencies {
    implementation("org.slf4j:slf4j-api:2.0.16")
    implementation("org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:2.0.16")
    ...
}

=== Exercise 0

Consider the following definitions.

.Exercise 0
[source, kotlin]
----
private val logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger("labs")

fun logJobState(job: Job) {
    logger.info("isActive={}, isCancelled={}, isCompleted={}", job.isActive, job.isCancelled, job.isCompleted)
}

object Ex0 {
    @JvmStatic
    fun main(args: Array<String>) {
        // alternative: runBlocking(Dispatchers.Default) {
        runBlocking {
            logger.info("top coroutine started")
            launch {
                logger.info("child coroutine started")
            }
            logger.info("Before thread sleep")
            Thread.sleep(1000)
            // alternative: delay(1000)
            logger.info("After sleep/delay on top-coroutine")
        }
    }
}
----

* Why does `child coroutine started` only appear after `After sleep/delay on top-coroutine`?

* Will the behavior be different if `sleep` is replaced with `delay`? If so, explain why?

* Will the behavior be different if we keep `sleep` and use 
`runBlocking(Dispatchers.Default)` to start the top coroutine? If so, explain why?

=== Exercise 1

Consider the following definitions.

.Exercise 1
[source, kotlin]
----
object Ex1 {
    @JvmStatic
    fun main(args: Array<String>) {
        runBlocking {
            val continuationInterceptor: ContinuationInterceptor = coroutineContext[ContinuationInterceptor]
                ?: throw IllegalStateException("coroutine context does not have expected element")

            logger.info("step 0")
            withContext(Dispatchers.Default) {
                logger.info("step 1")
                withContext(continuationInterceptor) {
                    logger.info("step 2")
                }
                logger.info("step 3")
            }
            logger.info("step 4")
        }
    }
}
----

* Without running the code, write down on which thread (or thread group) will each of the `logger.info` statements be executed.

* Confirm your analysis by running the code.

* What does the following statement do?
----
val continuationInterceptor: ContinuationInterceptor = coroutineContext[ContinuationInterceptor]
                ?: throw IllegalStateException("coroutine context does not have expected element")
----

* Why can a `ContinuationInterceptor` be used as a context?

=== Exercise 2

Consider the following definitions.

.Exercise 2
[source, kotlin]
----
object Ex2 {
    @JvmStatic
    fun main(args: Array<String>) {
        runBlocking {
            val job = launch {
                try {
                    logger.info("Inner coroutine started")
                    delay(2000)
                } catch (ex: Throwable) {
                    logger.info("Caught exception {} - {}", ex.javaClass.simpleName, ex.message)
                }
            }
            delay(1000)
            logJobState(job)
            logger.info("Cancelling inner coroutine")
            job.cancel()
            logJobState(job)
            delay(1)
            logJobState(job)
        }
        logger.info("after runBlocking")
    }
}
----

* There is an exception being thrown inside the inner coroutine. Where is that exceptions thrown? Why is that exception thrown?

* What is the type of the exception being thrown? Does that type derive from `kotlinx.coroutines.CancellationException`?

* Why does the first log message after `job.cancel` have `isCompleted=false`, while the log message after `delay(1)` has `isCompleted=true`?

=== Exercise 3

Consider the following definitions.

.Exercise 3
[source, kotlin]
----
object Ex3 {
    @JvmStatic
    fun main(args: Array<String>) {
        val scheduledExecutor = Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor()
        try {
            runBlocking {
                logger.info("top coroutine starting")
                val job = launch {
                    try {
                        suspendCancellableCoroutine { continuation ->
                            scheduledExecutor.schedule(
                                {
                                    logger.info("Calling continuation")
                                    continuation.resume(Unit)
                                },
                                1000,
                                TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS
                            )
                        }
                        logger.info("After suspendCancellableCoroutine")
                    } catch (ex: Throwable) {
                        logger.info("Caught exception {} - {}", ex.javaClass.simpleName, ex.message)
                    }
                }
                delay(500)
                job.cancel()
            }
        } finally {
            scheduledExecutor.shutdown()
        }
    }
}
----

* Is any exception thrown in the child coroutine? If so, why? Where is that exception thrown?

* Is the `continuation.resume` called before or after the `suspendCancellableCoroutine` call completes? Do you see any problem?

* What is the behavior if the delay duration is changed to 1500 milliseconds?

* What is the behavior if the delay duration is kept at 500 milliseconds and the `suspendCancellableCoroutine` is replaced with a `suspendCoroutine`?

* What happens if `shutdown` is _not_ called on the executor?

=== Exercise 4

Consider the following definitions.

.Exercise 4
[source, kotlin]
----
object Ex4 {
    @JvmStatic
    fun main(args: Array<String>) {
        runBlocking {
            logger.info("top starting")
            val job1 = launch {
                try {
                    delay(1000)
                    throw Exception("Oh No!")
                    logger.info("inner 1 ending")
                } catch (ex: Throwable) {
                    logger.info("inner 1: caught exception {} - {}", ex.javaClass.simpleName, ex.message)
                    throw ex
                }
            }

            val job2 = launch {
                try {
                    delay(2000)
                    logger.info("inner 2 ending")
                } catch (ex: Throwable) {
                    logger.info("inner 2: caught exception {} - {}", ex.javaClass.simpleName, ex.message)
                }
            }

            try {
                delay(2000)
            } catch (ex: Throwable) {
                logger.info("top: caught exception {} - {}", ex.javaClass.simpleName, ex.message)
            }
            logger.info("top ending")
        }
    }
}
----

* Why are exceptions thrown in the top coroutine and in the second child coroutine? In which statements are those exceptions thrown?

* Does the `runBlocking` call end by throwing an exception?

* If `throw Exception(...)` is replaced with `throw CancellationException()`, what is the change in behavior?
